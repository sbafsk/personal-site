# LinkedIn Experience Descriptions

## Disco | Florial | Uber — Cashier | Driver | Delivery
Before entering tech, I worked several customer-facing jobs. These roles taught me how to deal with people, manage my time, and stay organized under pressure. Nothing fancy, but solid groundwork for what came next.

## Asignet Technology DNA — Script Developer
My first tech job. I worked on a system that automated invoice downloads and data extraction. I wrote scripts that pulled invoices from different sources and built parsers to read and store the relevant data. It was repetitive work in a way, but it gave me a strong foundation in scripting, problem-solving, and understanding how data flows through systems.

## Intermedia — RPA Developer
Here I moved into proper automation work. I was involved in the full cycle: analyzing manual processes, figuring out what could be automated, building the bots, and deploying them. The company was going through an agile transformation at the time, so I also got hands-on experience with Scrum and learned how to work in sprints and collaborate more closely with stakeholders. This role helped me understand how automation can genuinely make a difference in people's daily work.

## BASF — SSr RPA Developer
This was a step up in complexity. I joined a global team based in Germany and worked on automations for internal clients across different departments. One of the main projects I worked on was a bot handling monthly account closings that integrated directly with SAP. It ran multiple instances in parallel and communicated with internal APIs. The work required more coordination, stricter code reviews, and a better understanding of enterprise systems. I learned a lot about working with international teams and delivering reliable solutions in a corporate environment.

## Career Break — Professional Development
After a couple of short stints at Deloitte and Overactive, I realized I wanted to shift my career toward web development. I took time off to study React and Node.js through online courses and personal projects. Eventually, I teamed up with some friends to take on freelance work, which gave me real-world experience building web apps from scratch. It was a reset that set the direction for the next phase of my career.

## Occupier — Software Engineer
I joined Occupier as a full stack developer working on their lease accounting platform. The product had a solid user base across the US, and I got to work on both maintaining existing features and building new ones. Some of the features I shipped came directly from user requests, which was rewarding because you could see the impact on retention and sales conversations. I also worked on migrating parts of the backend from REST to GraphQL, which improved how the frontend consumed data and made development faster overall. This role sharpened my skills in React, Rails, and working closely with product and customer success teams.

---

## Mimiquate — Software Engineer
A short contract role where I worked with Elixir and Phoenix for the first time. It was an onboarding-heavy experience, getting up to speed with a new stack and contributing to a codebase built around functional programming principles. I also worked on React components and GraphQL queries. The role was brief but gave me exposure to a different way of thinking about backend architecture.

---

## Trees Software — Founder
I started Trees as a way to take on software projects independently. It's a small operation where I handle everything from initial conversations with clients to architecture decisions and hands-on development. I've worked on web applications using Next.js, Ruby on Rails, and other tools depending on what fits the project. Running your own thing teaches you a lot beyond code — scoping work, managing expectations, and staying accountable when there's no one else to fall back on. It's still a work in progress, but it's mine.

## Hi Energy — Software Integration Engineer
My current role, focused on integrations. I work with Ruby on Rails to connect the platform with affiliate marketing networks and external services through REST APIs. The work involves understanding third-party systems, mapping data between them, and making sure everything flows reliably. I've also started incorporating AI-assisted tools into my workflow, which has been an interesting shift in how I approach day-to-day development.
