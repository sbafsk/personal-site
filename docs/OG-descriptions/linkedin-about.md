# LinkedIn About / Summary

Software developer with seven years of experience across automation, web development, and integrations. I started in RPA, moved into full stack work with React and Rails and connecting systems through APIs.

Along the way I've worked with global teams, shipped features that mattered to real users, and learned how to deliver reliably in different environments — from startups to enterprise. I also run my own small software studio on the side, which keeps me close to the full picture of building products.

Recently I completed a diploma in IT business management, which gave me a better understanding of leadership, product thinking, and how tech decisions connect to business outcomes. It's been a useful shift in perspective as I take on more responsibility.
