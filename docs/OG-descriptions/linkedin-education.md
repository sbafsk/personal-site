# LinkedIn Education Descriptions

## Escuela Superior de Informatica — Bachillerato TI, Computer Engineering
2010 - 2014

This is where it all started. I got my first real exposure to programming and how computers actually work. We covered the basics — logic, hardware, networking, and some early coding. It gave me a foundation to build on and helped me realize that I wanted to keep going down this path.

## INSTITUTO Escuela de Diseño y Comunicación BIOS — Diseñador Web
2015

A focused course on web design and development. I learned PHP and MySQL here, which at the time felt like the keys to building anything on the web. It was hands-on and practical — less theory, more building things. This was my first step into backend development.

## Universidad ORT Uruguay — Analista Programador
2018 - 2022

A more structured and complete education in software development. I learned how to think about systems, work in teams, and follow methodologies that actually matter in the industry. We worked with JavaScript, React, REST APIs, and version control — tools I still use every day. Beyond the technical side, it taught me how to communicate ideas, prioritize work, and lead when needed. This degree gave me the confidence to call myself a developer.

## European Open Business School — Diplomado en Dirección y Gestión de Empresas IT
2024 - 2025

A shift from purely technical work to understanding the business side of tech. This program covered project and product management, agile methodologies, AI and digital transformation, leadership, and data-driven decision making. It helped me see software from a different angle — not just how to build it, but how to manage teams, prioritize strategically, and think about the bigger picture. A good complement to my engineering background as I take on more responsibility in my career.
